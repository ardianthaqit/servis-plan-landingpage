# Starter Template

## Installation

Step #1: Install node modules 

```bash
npm i 
```

Step #2: Start grunt (with watch)

```bash
grunt build
```

## Bootstrap

To make this starter template as light as possible I have removed most of the styling 
that bootstrap adds leaving mostly the columns and rows.

Feel free to add all of bootstrap just remember that it can effect the page speed
